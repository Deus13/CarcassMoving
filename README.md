# Carcass Moving

Adds the ability to pick up and move wolf- and deercarcass. Player will be slowed by the weight of the carcass.


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** 1.56 by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.

The idea and the code are from Shield-Heart Relentless Night. I just recompiled it for 1.56.



Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
